/*
Info:
The message keyword defines the equivalent of a record in Avro.
Each field is declared with a name and type.
Repeated fields are used for arrays/lists, similar to Avro's array type.

The numbers from 1 to 14 represent the field numbers in Protocol Buffers.
Each field in a Protocol Buffers message must have a unique field number.
These field numbers are used to identify fields in the binary encoding of the message.
